	# Capacitance PF is great, easy to use, and standard/objective accross all soil types, densities, and conditions.
	# However, it has limited resolution (1 count / pF) and range (0-255pF). Depending on your application, you may want to use
	# raw counts instead for higher resolution and range.

	# The sensor will automatically configure the range of its "Raw Count" Readings based on 
	# the capacitance that it senses during power up/initialization. This allows it to maximize
	# resolution for the expected capacitance range. However, if the capacitance changes significantly
	# (for example, a moisture sensor going from dry to very wet), the raw count readings may saturate
	# and get stuck at a maximum value. You can run reset() again to recalibrate the raw count range if needed.
